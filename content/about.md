## About the project
Feminine-Boy.net is an open source community blog about Femboys.

The Project was originally founded by Feuerhamster in a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/feminineboys/comments/mf07r1/a_website_for_femboys/).

Femininity in men unfortunately does not have a good standing in society. That' s why we want to publish content on this website that educates and provides information about the topic.
The content is written by the community, which are people from all over the world who have a common ground with this topic.

## Our goals
- Create extensive resources for male persons wanting to be feminine.
- Fight against the issue that when you google femboys you find mostly NSFW content.
- Educate other people about the topic and help normalize feminine gender expression in boys.
- Create global, centralized and useful public content related to that topic.

## The community
The community and the organization of the project is done on a Discord server.
All important stuff as well as team internal things are discussed and organized there.
